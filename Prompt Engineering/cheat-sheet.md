This is my cheat sheet for writing effective prompts for ChatGPT. Creating effective prompts for ChatGPT can significantly improve the quality of the responses you receive.

## The components of a good prompt

### Task

**Give the model a specic task using a verb or ask an open ended question.**

- divide complex tasks into smaller, step-by-step instructions
- tell the AI how to solve your problem step-by-step

### Context

**Give background information to help ChatGPT understand your requirements.**

- answer the "W-questions"
- describe the situation

### Examplars

**Exemplars can drastically improve the quality of the output by giving specific examples for the AI to reference.**

- give examples of a good answer

### Persona

**Tell the AI who you would ideally want it to be in the given task situation.**

- persona can be a specific person (Steve Jobs, David Goggins, Batman etc.)
- or a description (a competent and polite customer support worker)

### Format

**Visualizing your desired end result will let you know what format to use in your prompt.**

- how should your desired result/answer look like?
- do you want the AI to use a specific framework for generating the answer?
  - e.g. SMART for setting goals or SWOT for project planning

### Tone

**And you can actually use ChatGPT to generate a list of Tone keywords for you to use!**

- how should the tone of the answer be?
- how should the answer sound?
- polite, considering, angry etc.
- pro tip: ask the AI for adjectives
