# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a process, by which LLMs can access external data, to give the user a more context-appropriate and fact-based response.

## Motivation

LLMs don't have access to external data. This could be recent data or publicly unavailable information. This is also one of the reasons LLMs hallucinate. So we have to give it access to extrenal data in order to get more context appropriate and fact-based responses.
