# Types of Data

## 1. **Nominal Data**

- **Description**: Represents categories without any inherent order. Used for labeling or classification.
- **Example**: Colors of cars (e.g., red, blue, green).

## 2. **Ordinal Data**

- **Description**: Represents categories with a meaningful order, but the differences between them are not measurable or uniform.
- **Example**: Customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied).

## 3. **Interval Data**

- **Description**: Numeric data with equal intervals between values but no true zero point, meaning you cannot meaningfully multiply or divide values.
- **Example**: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## 4. **Ratio Data**

- **Description**: Numeric data with equal intervals and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios and comparisons.
- **Example**: Weight of an object (e.g., 50 kg is twice as heavy as 25 kg).
