# Machine Learning Workflow

## 1. Data Collection

1.1. Collect the necessary data for training the machine learning model.  
1.2. Ensure the quantity and quality of data are adequate to achieve the desired model accuracy.  
1.3. Identify and address any missing values or irrelevant data points.  

## 2. Data Preparation

2.1. Clean the data by handling missing values (delete, average, or use algorithms).  
2.2. Remove duplicate data points to avoid bias and unnecessary storage.  
2.3. Normalize data values to ensure all features are on a comparable scale.  
2.4. Encode categorical data (like text entries) into numerical values.  
2.5. Shuffle or harmonize the dataset to prevent ordering bias.  
2.6. Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover internal relationships and dependencies.  

## 3. Data Splitting

3.1. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets (often in an 80/20 or 70/30 ratio).  
3.2. Split the training set further into training and validation sets, possibly using k-fold cross-validation for thorough evaluation.  

## 4. Model Selection

4.1. Choose a suitable machine learning model based on the problem type (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning).  

## 5. Model Training

5.1. Train the model using the designated training data.  
5.2. Monitor performance during training to adjust as necessary.  

## 6. Model Validation

6.1. Validate the model using the validation dataset to check its performance without bias.  
6.2. Use performance metrics to assess accuracy (e.g., mean absolute error) and adjust as needed.  

## 7. Parameter Tuning

7.1. Experiment with different model parameters to optimize performance.  
7.2. Adjust training steps, learning rates, feature subsets, or dataset distributions as required.  

## 8. Final Testing

8.1. Conduct a final test using the reserved test dataset to evaluate real-world performance.  
8.2. Revisit earlier steps if results are unsatisfactory, iterating through various adjustments.  

## 9. Workflow Iteration

9.1. Understand that the machine learning workflow is iterative, often requiring looping back to previous steps for improvements.
